# Articles of Association for Pulumiverse

Pulumiverse is an online community to share ideas,
projects and build Open Source software amongst Pulumi users, developers and
enthusiasts.

This document regulates this community; you'll find information about
becoming a contributor, how and when to vote for board members and how policies
are changed.

## Contributors

Contributors are the core of Pulumiverse. To become a contributor, all you have
to do is open an issue(s) or pull request(s). Contributors can earn voting
rights by either becoming a member of the Open Source Initiative, submitting
more than ten contributions collectively across Pulumiverse GitHub organization repositories annually, or being an active maintainer of a repository in the Pulumiverse GitHub organization. Voting
rights are only made valid by being added to the membership roster (feel free to
open a pull request).

## Community-elected Board

Pulumiverse has a board that consists of five board members. Board members hold
their role for two years; voting is staggered as such:

We elect board members 1 and 2 in year 1, elected for two years. In year 2, we
elect board members 3, 4 and 5. We elect board members 3, 4 and 5 for one year
the first year.

Anyone (regardless of contributor or voting rights status) be can be nominated to become a board member, either by being nominated
by others or sending your nomination to current board members before the annual
community meeting. In addition, employees of Pulumi Corporation (or people directly
connected with Pulumi Corporation) are welcome to participate as board members, but with no
more than two members are currently employed by Pulumi Corporation.

## Governance Meeting

The governance meeting is the highest level of influence and ability for change in the Pulumiverse
organization. All contributors and members are welcome to join the governance
meeting. Voting rights are not required to spectate and post suggestions.

At least one governance meeting will be held annually by 1 November. This yearly governance
meeting has a fixed schedule:

- Boards Reporting (to summarize the year)
- Changes to policies
- Documents Election

Community members can send suggestions to change the governing documents and
raise issues; no later than two weeks before the annual community meeting.

Community members can call for a governance meeting when at least 30% of all
members with voting rights call for it.

## Transparency

Building community trust in the governance of an open-source project is vital
to its success. To that end, decision making must be done in a transparent,
open fashion. No decisions about the project’s direction, bug fixes or features
may be done without community involvement and participation. Discussions must
begin at the earliest possible point on a topic; the community’s participation
is vital during the entire decision-making process.
