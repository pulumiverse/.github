# Contributing to Pulumiverse

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just
guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgement and feel free to propose
changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, open an issue to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as
  changes are developed.

## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
specification to standardize our commit history. To encourage this convention on
commit messages and/or pull request titles, we use the
[Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests) bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending
the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an
imperative, present tense sentence (without a period). Example:
`fix: make header bold`.

If you are still working on your pull request, prepend `WIP:` to indicate that
it's work in progress or use the draft pull requests feature.

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix,
chore, feat, etc.) Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`
