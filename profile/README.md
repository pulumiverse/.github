The repository is made to create a place where people can talk about Pulumi. The intention of this organization and community is to provide Pulumi-based libraries, made by the community. The idea was initiated by a [Reddit comment][reddit-comment].

## Want to join the discussion?

Create an issue, introduce what you want to bring to the Pulumiverse community – and off you go!

## Motivation

There are many libraries or collections of components for Pulumi out there. Most of them are made based on requirements of individual companies and developers. Pulumiverse aims to make a community where these libraries can be created, where opinionated configurations for Pulumi resources can be stored and discussed.
